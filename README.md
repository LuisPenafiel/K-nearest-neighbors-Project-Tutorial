# K-nearest Movie recommendation system
## Instructions

### Description of the problem
Would we be able to predict which movies might or might not be a commercial success? This dataset collects part of the knowledge from the API TMDB, which contains only 5000 movies out of the total number. The following resources are available:

#### Step 0: Pip & Requirements, Imports, Initalization

#### Step 1: Import Data

#### Step 2: Conexion a SQL
we connect ourselves to the Database using SQl

#### Step 3-7: Preprocessing Genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview 
Preprocessing the data is a crucial step in preparing your data for k-nearest training

#### Step 8: Vsiualize data
Visualize the relationship between budget, popularity, and revenue with the size of the points representing the absolute value of the budget and the color representing the revenue.

#### Step 9 K-nearest Model
we deploy the Model

#### Step 10: Recomend the movies Data + Model
we use the trained model to recommend movies based on their proximity in a multi-dimensional feature space. 

#### Step 11: save the model
